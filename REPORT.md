## Introduction

- Give a brief description of the design and a summary of the relevant background information related to the topic. Give a rationale about what is needed and why.
- Give the reader an overview of what is in the next sections.
- Do not put any detailed results of your work here.

## Design Problem
This will have the following:

### Problem Definition
Write a problem statement of the project. 

### Design Requirements
This will have the following:

#### Functions

- Provide functions of the design project. Remember that the functions contain verbs.

#### Objectives

- Provide objectives of the design project. Remember that the objectives are specified as adjectives.

#### Constraints

- Provide constraints here. Remember that the constraints are binary (either satisfied or not).

## Solution

Provide an account of some solutions your team brainstormed to implement the project. Some solutions might not have all the desired features, some might not satisfy the constraints, or both. These solutions come up in your mind while you brainstorm ways of implementing all the features while meeting the constraints. Towards, the end you select a solution that you think has all the features and satisfies all the constraints. Remember that an engineering design is iterative in nature!
