# Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local businesses frequently face challenges in growing their customer base due to intense competition, which result in their websites ranking lower in search results. To solve this issue, we are designing a platform called "FIA (Find It ALL)-Local-Service-Finder" that aims to enhance the online visibility of local businesses. This platform allows users to list their services as well as request services, thereby fostering a mutually beneficial ecosystem for businesses and customers alike.

# Design Problem

## Problem Definition

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local businesses often struggle to grow due to high competition and lack of effective SEO (Search Engine Optimization), causing their websites to rank lower in search results. To address this issue, we are creating a platform where users can both list their services and request services, helping local businesses improve their online visibility and attract more customers.

## Design Requirements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design requirements for our platform are structured around a series of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). Each MVP phase builds upon the previous one, progressively adding more functionality and enhancing the user experience.

### Functions

#### MVP 1
- <b>Create and manage service listings:</b> Users can add, update, and remove their service listings, providing details such as description, pricing, and availability
- <b>Search for and request services:</b> Users can search for specific services based on various criteria and send requests to service providers

#### MVP 2
- <b>Provide a user-friendly interface:</b> The platform will offer an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface to enhance user experience
- <b>Ensure secure user authentication:</b> The system will include secure login mechanisms to protect user accounts and data

#### MVP 3
- <b>Implement a review and rating system:</b> Users can leave reviews and ratings for services they have used, helping others make informed decisions
- <b>Offer personalized recommendations:</b> The platform will suggest services to users based on their preferences and past activities


### Objectives

#### MVP 1

- <b>Comprehensive:</b> The platform should provide all necessary features for service listing, discovery, and management
- <b>Data Integrity:</b> Ensure that all data is accurate, consistent, and reliable by implementing thorough validation and testing mechanisms throughout the system

#### MVP 2
- <b>User-friendly:</b> The platform should be easy to use, with a clean and intuitive design
- <b>Responsive:</b> The platform should work well on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones
- <b>Secure:</b> Ensure the safety and privacy of user data through robust security measures

#### MVP 3
- <b>Efficient:</b> The system should handle multiple requests smoothly, with minimal delays
- <b>Scalable:</b> The platform should be able to grow and handle an increasing number of users and services
- <b>Reliable:</b> The system should have high uptime and be available when users need it

### Constraints

- <b>Economic factors:</b> The project must be developed within a budget of $1000. Cost-effective solutions should be sought to minimize expenses without compromising quality
- <b>Reliability:</b> The system must have high uptime and be reliable, ensuring that users can access the platform whenever needed. It should handle at least 100 simultaneous users without performance issues
- <b>Societal impacts:</b> The platform must positively impact local communities by helping local businesses improve their online visibility and attract more customers
- <b>Ethics:</b> The platform should adhere to ethical standards, ensuring fair treatment of all users, preventing discrimination, and avoiding misuse for fraudulent or harmful activities

# Solution

ToDo:

Provide an account of some solutions your team brainstormed to implement the project. Some solutions might not have all the desired features, some might not satisfy the constraints, or both. These solutions come up in your mind while you brainstorm ways of implementing all the features while meeting the constraints. Towards, the end you select a solution that you think has all the features and satisfies all the constraints. Remember that an engineering design is iterative in nature!
